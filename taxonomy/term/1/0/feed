 <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered about the secrets of self made millionaires?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you&#039;ve noticed that trust fund babies and lottery winners do an excellent job... of spending all their money! Meanwhile, other folks with money seem to get richer and richer over time. That&#039;s because people who come into money easily don&#039;t have the skills to build wealth, and mistakenly don&#039;t think they need them. They have money, right? I mean, whoops, they HAD money.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that buying stocks is how to become a self made millionaire. Stocks have their place on the road to wealth, that&#039;s true. But most truly wealthy people don&#039;t just own stocks; they own real estate, businesses, companies, and natural resources. They control their futures because they control their assets. They know how to make money, and they know that passive investments just aren&#039;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think you could learn the steps to become a millionaire? Don&#039;t you love to fantasize about what it would be like to be rich? It&#039;s a fun fantasy. And the reality is even better. Everyone thinks they want to be a millionaire, but few think about how the money making might actually make it happen. Most people don&#039;t think to learn what&#039;s involved. A lot of ordinary people think of becoming a millionaire as something that involves extraordinary talents and/or luck. But they&#039;re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you have to do to be a millionaire? Well, you could always start by being a billionaire! Yeah, we know... bad joke. But no, on a more serious note.., there are two ways you can move financially: up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you earn less than you spend, you&#039;re moving in the wrong direction. If the reverse is true, you&#039;re moving in the right direction. If you continue to move in the right direction, you can achieve financial freedom and if you focus on your goals and continue to build wealth, you can eventually become a millionaire.&lt;/p&gt;
