    <div class="content"><p>Have you ever wondered about the secrets of self made millionaires?</p>
<p>Perhaps you've noticed that trust fund babies and lottery winners do an excellent job... of spending all their money! Meanwhile, other folks with money seem to get richer and richer over time. That's because people who come into money easily don't have the skills to build wealth, and mistakenly don't think they need them. They have money, right? I mean, whoops, they HAD money.</p>
<p>Self made millionaires and other people who succeed with wealth building really aren't secrets at all. What they do to make and keep their money is all about the skills and practices of success principles, and anyone can learn them.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it's necessary to learn how to invest wisely. This model of investment is not taught in business schools. After all, if business school professors knew how to make a million dollars, wouldn't they be, um, doing it? Most people who "teach" in the traditional system of wealth acquisition are using outdated information and models.</p>
<p>In the age of the internet, the ways that money gets built and changes hand is evolving at a rapid pace. Wealth coaches who are actively involved in building wealth themselves are on top of this game and can advise you to the changing face of business better than anyone who is committed to "traditional" economics.</p>
<p>The road to wealth is paved with investments. Actually, it's more like a staircase, on which investments build upon investments. This is called the wealth cycle. Successful millionaires put their energies into tracking, predicting, and taking advantage of the changing economy to build their investments wisely. They invest money, get a return, invest that money, get more returns, invest THAT money, etc. Even when the economy is doing poorly, there are always sectors that are growing. When real estate is "down", natural resources are often "up", to give you an example.</p>
<p>Some people think that investing is only for people who are already rich. If you're one of those people, think again! There are investments of only a few thousand dollars each all around you. How much does it cost to buy a small, empty lot? Undeveloped land is often a good choice, especially if it seems like the area around it is being developed.</p>
<p>Even if you are in debt right now, you can enter the wealth cycle and begin your rise towards a million. The wealth cycle works best if you make an investment as soon as you can - then use your high returns to get out of debt faster. If the percentage on your return is high enough, you will come out ahead.</p>
<p><b>Here are the steps to help you get your wealth cycle off to a good start:</b></p>
<p><b>1. Create a wealth account.</b></p>
<p>This is a fund that you set aside solely for investing. Make a fixed payment to it every month, say 5-10% of your monthly income and never touch that money for any other reason.</p>
<p><b>2. Invest!</b></p>
<p>Once you have a few thousand in your wealth account, invest it into good opportunities that you have researched carefully. A wealth coach can help you make a solid choice.</p>
<p><b>3. Set up your own businesses.</b></p>
<p>Corporations LLCs, partnerships, etc. are crucial to protect your money. In addition, they generate income.</p>
<p><b>4. Maximize tax strategies.</b></p>
<p>Your accountant should be able to advise you on the best way to structure your businesses to keep as much of your money as possible.</p>
<p><b>5. Set up a Cash Creator.</b></p>
<p>A Cash Creator does one thing: brings in money. Cash Creators are an essential element to sustaining the wealth cycle.</p>
<p><b>6. Reinvest your earnings.</b></p>
<p>The money that is generated from your first investments goes into more money-making investments. This is the open secret of a <a href="become-a-self-made-millionaire-secret-a-cash-machine.html">self made millionaire</a> - keep your money working for you all the time!</p>
<p>The process of building sustainable wealth is one of constantly turning income into assets and assets into income. This is difficult to do when you work for someone else. An employee builds money, alright - for the owner of the company! Instead of spending all your energies building wealth for somebody else as an employee, you will want to put your creativity, energy, and attention into making your own dreams come true as the owner of your own companies. The freedoms of being your own boss are just an additional perk to help you enjoy life on the road to wealth. These are the secrets of a millionaire.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as an entirely "safe" investment. Every investment brings its own set of risks, it's just that some have more than others do. Traditional investments, such as stock funds, have two different kinds of risk: the small risk that you will lose money on the stock, and the bigger risk that you will make money - but only a little, just enough to keep you from pulling out and trying something else.</p>
<p>Modest returns make it impossible to enter the wealth cycle. For your wealth cycle to succeed, you will need to invest in a wide range of assets, such as real estate, natural resources, business ownership, and somewhat higher risk speculative ventures. Diversifying your options is a wonderful way to protect your wealth.</p>
<p>Active investing of this caliber requires the guidance and support of a professional team. Think of them as you "wealth team". As your needs grow and change, so will the makeup of your wealth team. Making money requires cooperation. After all, "money" itself is something that needs everyone's cooperation to work! Otherwise, it's pretty green paper with a bunch of germs on it.</p>
<p>You can't succeed all by yourself. Meeting any major goal in life requires a little help. One thing is for sure, though - the biggest of the secrets of self made millionaires is that they are far from completely self-made. To build your million, you'll need accountants, partners, wealth coaches, lawyers, friends, allies, and more. With these people, with hard work, and with determination, the path to becoming a millionaire will be a lot quicker and stress free.</p>
