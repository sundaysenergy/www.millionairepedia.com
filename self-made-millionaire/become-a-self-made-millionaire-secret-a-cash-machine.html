                             <div class="node">



    <div class="content"><p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">Do you think that if you work hard enough, you could become a self made millionaire? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">Most people grow up knowing about work - after all, most of us were raised by people with jobs! But that doesn't mean that we really understand how to earn money. Learning to earn money is more than just bringing home a paycheck. The definition of "job" is something you wouldn't choose to do unless you were being paid. "Earning money" means accumulating wealth so that you don't have to have a "job". A millionaire in the making is someone who focuses their energies and passions thoroughly on earning money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">The world is full of self made millionaires. These are people who have learned to think, act, and invest like wealthy people - and by doing so, become wealthy themselves. Many people, especially women, rely on someone else to bring income into their household. Even in the best of relationships, depending completely on another person to meet your financial needs is a risky way to secure your future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">Many people who work at salaried jobs feel that they've come to a dead end, and can't really get ahead or increase their earnings. If you want to be a millionaire, however, you can't allow yourself to be defined by what someone else thinks you're worth. You can only become a self made millionaire by deciding for yourself what you're worth, that it's a lot, and then go out and get it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;"><b>To become a self made millionaire, you need to find a Cash Creator.</b> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">A Cash Creator is a business that both generates consistent income and increases that income over time. This can be achieved by adding value to a current business, or starting a new one. A Cash Creator is essential to building a cycle of wealth. Simply put, a Cash Creator brings in money that can be used for another, additional investment, which also brings in money, which allows for another investment... you get the picture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">Perhaps you aren't interested in being an entrepreneur. You've never wanted to have your own business, and you don't want to quit your steady job. Well, you don't have to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">The point of a Cash Creator isn't to put together your dream business, or to be the captain of your own boat 24/7. A Cash Creator is simply an additional income stream. Therefore, it might take the form of a second job, a low-risk eBay store, your own mini website or some other revenue generator that works for you. Use what you already have in terms of skills and resources to build a business, then allow that venture to grow over time. This approach to creating wealth is relatively safe and comfortable for most people - although it does require some elbow grease!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: verdana,geneva;">Here's what a Cash Creator can do for you:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><b>1. Generate income for debts, regular expenses. Build wealth.<br /></b></span><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><b></b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><b>2. Give you experience running a business.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">One great definition of wealth is "the creation of abundant resources through the actualization of your skills and gifts." Many people fantasize about their ideal business, regardless of whether they already have the skill set necessary to run it. Yes, you can eventually go for your dream business - but if you don't learn the fundamentals of running a business first, you aren't too likely to succeed. A Cash Creator, in addition to generating momentum to your wealth cycle, is a learning tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">When selecting the right revenue stream for your Cash Creator, begin with what you already know. Here are a few examples:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">If you're a teacher... start your own tutoring business on the side.<br />If you work in the computer industry... start your own repair/upgrade business on the weekends.<br />If you love to cook... put together an e-book full of your favorite recipes and sell it online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">A business of this type will help you hone the general skills that any business owner needs, such as marketing, sales, finance, management, and operations. Once you have experience with these aspects of business, you are free to start your ideal business. You can focus on the aspects of the business that make it special, rather than hustling to get up to speed on "business". With your increased confidence and new leadership skills, you'll project the air of success that allows other people to believe in you and your dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">For many people, the biggest obstacle to success lies inside your brain. Lots of folks with the cash and assets to start a business are too afraid of failure to do so. They think that working for someone else is the only way to be financially secure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Well, guess what? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Every business is owned by someone. Most of those people are of absolutely average intelligence and ability, and many never earned a Cash Creator to teach them the fundamental skills of a business, the way you will. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">So which sounds safer to you - trusting yourself to take care of your own needs, or trusting somebody else (who may or may not know or care about you) to do it? It's got to be one or the other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Additionally, if you're creating your own wealth cycle, you are free to put your money wherever it is best invested at the moment rather than rely on an employer or an investment fund. Given the current state of the economy, this can only be a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">If you still have doubts about this approach to becoming a self made millionaire and learning the <a href="../secrets-self-made-millionaires-review.html">secrets of self made millionaires</a>, think about the following question: How many famous millionaires do you know of who are working as someone else's employee? If you want an answer to the question, "how do I become a millionaire?" you will have to begin with the basics of a cash creator plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><b>Cash Creator Plan</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Putting together a Cash Creator isn't difficult, but it does require systematic planning. Here's how to go about it:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><b>1. Identify the marketable skills you already have.<br />2. Use those skills to put together a Cash Creator.<br />3. Pick up the skills necessary to run any business.<br />4. Take those business skills and move upwards into any field you wish.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Let's say you want to open up a Thai restaurant. You love Thai food. You eat Thai food every day. You have dreams about Mee Krob all night long. Is a Thai restaurant your millionaire maker? No, not if it doesn't make good use of your existing skills, and especially if you've never run a business before. Luckily, you're only going to have to postpone your dreams a little while. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Pick a business option that is a natural fit for what you know today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Let's say you're a bus driver and own your own van. You could run a shuttle service on your days off. Or possibly include a driving tour past all the Thai restaurants in town, with stops for snacks at the best ones. Once you've earned enough cash from your shuttle business and have gotten the processes of invoicing and time management and taxes and all that good stuff down, then you can think about opening your restaurant. Plus, you'll know your competition intimately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><b>The Basics</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Whatever you ultimately choose to do, your first business should:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">1. Be easy to start as in, up and able to make money in the first <br />couple days.</span></p>
<p>2. NOT take more time out of your life than you can afford to give it.</p>
<p>3. NOT stretch your abilities to manage the business, although if it's TOO easy, then you won't learn what you need to. </p>
<p>4. Diversify your cash stream.</p>
<p>5. Give you a good return on your investment.</p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><b>Once you've figured out what marketable skills you already have and are thinking about a business that use them, it's a help to consider these thoughts:</b> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">1. Your business does not have to be limited to skills you've acquired recently. Let's say you were a groundskeeper in college - you might open up a landscaping business now.</span></p>
<p>2. Find out what is already happening in your skill area among local business, and see where there might be an empty niche. For example, there might be lots of landscapers in your town, but none who specialize in roses like the lovely ones in yours garden.</p>
<p>3. Find someone who has walked this path before you. A millionaire mentor can help you choose the best business for you to begin.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">Passion comes to those who work for it. If you're lucky, your dream business and your Cash Creator might actually be the same business. But please keep in mind that the role of the Cash Creator is not to make you happy. You know what skills you have, but you might not yet know what skills you'd most like to have. Once you have some extra revenue in hand and a world of options before you, be prepared for your dreams to change. Passions change throughout life, and there's no telling where your interests will lead you once you give them a bit of free rein.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">It isn't necessarily true that if you do what you love, the money will follow. Ask any aspiring novelist how that's worked out for him - if he has time to chat in between waiting on tables at your Thai restaurant. (If he asks you for a loan, don't give it to him.) Hold onto your regular job until your Cash Creator has built up enough revenue for you to launch full time to the next step of your plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;">The role of the Cash Creator is to make you money, so you can kick-start and then feed your wealth cycle. It not only creates money for you, it teaches the business skills that any self made millionaire needs in his ventures. Once you have that part down, you can begin to reach for the stars.</span></p>
